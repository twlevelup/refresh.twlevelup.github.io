###What am I going to learn?

This five week interactive workshop is designed to help you bridge the gap between university and your first full time job. You will learn about Agile software development and we will instill a curiosity in you around useful concepts like continuous delivery, test automation, pairing, test-driven development, retrospectives and more.

###How?

Having lots of fun! Working professionals are fully immersed in this five week interactive workshop teaching concepts we think you should know through hands-on activities, interactive sessions, discussions, games and more.

###When is it?

Starting March 2015 we will be running a series of workshops from 6pm on the following evenings.

- Wednesday 11th March
- Wednesday 18th March
- Wednesday 25th March
- Wednesday 1st April
- Easter break, no session this evening 8th April
- Wednesday 15th April

###What do I need to bring?

Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided.

###Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?

Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, to keep this awesome experience free for you, places are limited as our physical location is our constraining factor!
