###What am I going to learn?

This conference is designed to help you bridge the gap between university and your first full time job. You will learn about Agile software development and hopefully we instigate curiosity in you around some useful concepts like continuous delivery, test automation, pairing, test-driven development, retrospectives and more.

###How?

Having lots of fun! Working professionals are fully immersed in this one day conference teaching concepts we think you should know through hands-on activities, interactive sessions, discussions, games and more.

###When is it?

The 3rd of May from 9:00am to 5:00pm - and we stay around for a chat but that is completely up to you.

###What do I need to bring?

Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided.

###Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?

Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, to keep this awesome experience free for you, places are limited as our physical location is our constraining factor!
