###Who is this for?

LevelUp is for students approaching the end of their studies who are seeking an insight into the real world of software development.

###What am I going to learn?

This conference is designed to help you bridge the gap between university and your first full time job. You will learn about Agile software development, continuous delivery, test-driven development, experience design, business analysis and more.

###How?

Having lots of fun! Working professionals are fully immersed in this one day conference teaching concepts we think you should know through hands-on activities, interactive sessions, discussions, games and more.

###When is it?

The 22nd of August from 9:00am to 5:00pm - and we'll stick around for a chat afterwards.

###What do I need to bring?

Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided.

###Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?

Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, to keep this awesome experience free for you, places are limited as our physical location is our constraining factor!
