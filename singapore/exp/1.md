### What am I going to learn?

LevelUp EXP (EXP stands for 'Express') is a one-day conference style event designed 
to help you bridge the gap between university and your first full time job. 
You will learn about [Agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
and hopefully we ignite a spark of curiosity in you around some useful concepts like 
continuous delivery, test automation, pair programming, test-driven development, retrospectives and more!

### How?

Having lots of fun! Real world consultants become your coaches in this one-day conference, teaching concepts we think you should know through hands-on activities, interactive sessions, discussions and games.

### When is it?

The 11th of October from 10:00am to 6:00pm - and we stay around for a chat but that is completely up to you.

### What do I need to bring?

Nothing! Food and drinks will be provided.

### Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?

While the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, to keep this awesome experience free for you, places are limited as our physical location is our constraining factor!

After you register, keep an eye out from us that will let you know if your spot is confirmed.
